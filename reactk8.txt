your react application should be in a pod as well inside the cluster
whenver the user open your web app first thing we will do is to connect the user with our react app server
the goal of react app server is to generate html css js file out of server and send it to user browser
react app server is not making any request to comment query post etc 

once html css and js is generated by react app server, the server is no longer relevent isk itna 
he kaam tha. All these request are coming from browser not from react app itself

to make sure raect app reach out to all the pods inside cluster there are 2 options avalibale

1) this option is not good, we wont do this. 
we could create node port service for diffrent pods, which expose pod to the outside world i.e browser.
ports are given randomly in node port react app may baar baar change karna parayga

2) We are going to create load balancer service
Our react app is going to make request to load balancer service and we are going to write some logic in load balancer server
thats is going to take user to diffrent pods like commment pod or query pod etc 



LOAD BALANCER SERVICE 
A LBS is going to tell the cluster to reach out to its provider. The goal of LBS is 
to get traffic in single pod

Ingress Controller or Ingress
Ingress or Ingress Controller are technically diffrent thing
Ingress has set of routing rules  in it that are going to distribute traffic to other service inside our cluster 

LBS is a special little thing, we have created services, pods, deployment inside cluster but the LBS is created
outside of  cluster


THE LBS CONFIG FILE is going to tell to reach out to cloud privder jaha apka cluster deploye hua wa hai, filhaal local machine hai
and pod ki lBS supply karo
this lbs is part of cloud not clusterx
ye traffic outside world say lega and pod ki taraf traffic direct karay ga


React app ko sirf itna paata hai kay ek route per request deni hai
lbs ye decide karay ga konsa pod ye request jani hai acc to route 
lbs is not doing full thing for us. yaha Ingress ata hai. ingress ek pod hai that has set of routing
rules inside of it and ye pod lbs kay sath sath kaam karayga
