Now to communicate post pod with event bus pod you have to create a deployment first for event bus then
a pod for event bus
now 2 pods are created to make them communicate we use service specficaly for this scenario we 
use clusted id service

cannot communicate 2 pods directly because pods ko ports randomly assigne hotay hen


there are 2 ways of attaching service with deployment, one step is to write service config code inside
deployment config file in my case it is (post-depl.yaml or event-bus-depl.yaml) 
2nd step is to create seperate file for attaching service config code (like i did in posts-srv.config)
with deployment object always remember this service config code will be written after below "---" check
file posts-depl.yaml or event-bus.yaml

service config code may ager service type mention nahi kartay tou by default wo cluster iP service he banata hai

 deployment or service kay  metadata may donu kay name diffrent must hai

 name should be diffrent ager ek deployment ki ek say ziada service ban rahi hen tou wanra k8 saamajta hai
 ek he service ko doosri service bnaya jara hai like nodePort may metadata>name diffrent hai donu service mau
