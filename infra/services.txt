Now to communicate post pod with event bus pod you have to create a deployment first for event bus then
a pod for event bus
now 2 pods are created to make them communicate we use service specficaly for this scenario we 
use clusted id service

cannot communicate 2 pods directly because pods ko ports randomly assigne hotay hen


there are 2 ways of attaching service with deployment, one step is to write service attaching code inside
deployment config file in my case it is (post-depl.yaml or event-bus-depl.yaml) or create seperate file for attaching service with 
deployment object
