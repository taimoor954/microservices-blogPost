annonation will tell the ingress controller that we are about to feed some routing rules to it x`

path means ager /posts kay path per koi request aie tou send it to posts ka cluster Ip service

we can hosts many diffrent apps at many diffrent domains inside one cluster  tabhi host array hai

jitni bhi apps ek clustrer may hosy ho unsab ka domain tou ek he hoga inside local machine and that will be
localhost
so hum c>windows>system32<drivers>etc>hosts may jaingay and posts ko as localhost use karayengay
ab jab bhi posts.com/posts search karo gay tou wo as a localhost he behave karay ga
behind the scene wo apko posts ka GET return karay ha
